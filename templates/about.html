                <h2 class="text-primary">Hello! I'm the Creator of UnBoreMe 👋</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Joy Ann, the person who created UnBoreMe. This website is my final 
                    project, made as a requirement for my final projects in three different subjects.
                     I built this platform to apply what I have learned in my classes and to challenge 
                     myself to complete a full project from start to finish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently a second-year college student at Laguna University University, taking BSIT – System Development. 
                    When I’m not working on this project, I enjoy playing games, learning new things, and thinking about how to make UnBoreMe better. 
                    This project means a lot to me because it shows how much I’ve learned and how far I’ve come.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">About UnBoreMe 🎮</h2>
                <p>
                    UnBoreMe is my final project, created as part of my journey in learning web
                     development and game programming. I built this platform to challenge myself by 
                     combining everything I’ve learnedbackend development, frontend design, and game 
                     logic into one complete project.
                </p>
                <p>
                   This project represents both my technical growth and my passion for games. Every 
                   feature, from user authentication to game scoring and the overall design, was 
                   carefully implemented to meet the requirements of my final project while also 
                   creating something genuinely fun to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UnBoreMe is not just an academic requirement—it’s a reflection of what I can 
                    build, how I solve problems, and how I turn ideas into working systems.
                </p>
